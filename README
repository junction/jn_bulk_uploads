2. Installation
-------------------
There are two steps necessary to complete the install.
a. Run the "Junction Networks Bulk Uploader" package installer
b. Due to SSL verification issues the follow command needs to be executed as root.
      sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts \
        	-file <path-to-cert-file>/cert/www.jnctn.com \
		-alias www.jnctn.com \ 
		-keystore /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/lib/security/cacerts 

      - Enter your root password to execute keytool
      - When prompted for the "keystore password", the default pwd is "changeit"
      

3. Development
--------------------
In order to setup the development enviroment the following resources need to be configured.
a. The source code - src/
b. The resources (property files, log configurations,  and images) - src/resources
c. lib dependencies - lib/

Additionally, to setup the testing environment.
a. Requires junit
b. The test cases - test/
c. The resources used in the test cases  - test/resources

4. Git Repository
---------------------
git@github.com:junction/jn_bulk_uploads.git

5. Fixes / Enhancements 
------------------------
a. Upon a successful upload; username, domain, and CSV are cached so that end users don't have to re-enter their params.
b. End users can launch and view the log file after executing the upload directly from confirmation modal
c. Executes upload process by hitting the Enter key
d. Modified username extraction by supporting e-mail addresses with Uppercase notations
e. Set focus on Password Textfield if Username has been filled
f. Enhanced logging by showing results of the executed process.  (i.e. how many Users added, how many voicemails added)
g. Hid one of two portions of logging that writes password in clear text to log

^^^^^^^^^^
- Added support for batch uploading or importing Phones, specifically Polycom phones.
- Wrote an Ant based build utiilty.

6. Packaging
-----------------------
Created an Ant based build file. Executing "Ant compile" will compile all the source, create the Jar files,
run the Jar Bundler utility, and initiate PackageMaker.
In order to Run "Ant compile" Both Ant and "JarBundler.jar" (http://informagen.com/JarBundler/) are required.

Created the app bundle using "Jar Bundler" followed by "PackageMaker". These come with XCode.

7. TODOs
-----------------------
- Remove cleartext password from logging
- Refactor auto-generated swing based UI code
- Enhance PC Support
- Modify Progress bar to show immediate processing. Currently, their is a bit of a lag, so the app appears a bit stagnant.

8. Using
------------------------
Please Review #2 (Installation) Of this README file.  The Bulk Uploader will install properly but will fail to run if #2 (Installation) isn't executed.
The Bulk Uploader comes in a Mac Package Installer.  Running the installer will drop the "Junction Networks Bulk Uploader.app"
into Mac Applications.  Runnning the app requires a number of fields to be entered.
I.   OnSIP username
II.  OnSIP password
III. OnSIP domain
IV.  File Selection of a CSV file.

There are two optional formats.  The first will upload User data, and the second will upload Phone data.
1. Users example: 
*********************************************************
First,Last,Extension,Email,Voicemail(Y/N)
test_123,test_565,2121,cust_1234@example.com,Y
********************************************************
The first line is assumed to be the header and is required.  The script will start reading data from the second line of the CSV file.
First Name, Last Name, Extension, Email, Include Voicemail (Y, N)

2. Phone example:
*********************************************************
MacAddress, Make (all polycom for now), Model, GMT Offset
0004f2accaca, Polycom, Polycom Soundpoint 330, 4
