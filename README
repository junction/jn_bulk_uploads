There are two steps necessary to complete the install.

		-alias www.jnctn.com \ 
		-keystore /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/lib/security/cacerts 

      - Enter your root password to execute keytool
      - When prompted for the "keystore password", the default pwd is "changeit"

5. Fixes / Enhancements

b. End users can launch and view the log file after executing the upload directly from confirmation modal
c. Executes upload process by hitting the Enter key
d. Modified username extraction by supporting e-mail addresses with Uppercase notations
e. Set focus on Password Textfield if Username has been filled

g. Hid one of two portions of logging that writes password in clear text to log

6. Packaging
-----------------------
On the Mac. Created the app bundle using "Jar Bundler" followed by "PackageMaker"

7. TODOs
-----------------------
- Remove cleartext password from logging
- Refactor auto-generated swing based UI code
- Enhance PC Support
- Modify Progress bar to be show immediate processing. Currently, their is a bit of a lag, so the app appears a bit stagnant.
