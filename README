2. Installation
----------------
There are two steps necessary to complete the install.
a. Run the "Junction Networks Bulk Uploader" package installer
b. Due to SSL verification issues the follow command needs to be executed as root.
      sudo keytool -import -trustcacerts \
        	-file <path-to-cert-file>/cert/www.jnctn.com \
		-alias www.jnctn.com \ 
		-keystore /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/lib/security/cacerts 

      - Enter your root password to execute keytool
      - When prompted for the "keystore password", the default pwd is "changeit"
      

3. Development
---------------
In order to setup the development enviroment the following resources need to be configured.
a. The source code - src/
b. The resources (property files, log configurations,  and images) - src/resources
c. lib dependencies - lib/

Additionally, to setup the testing environment.
a. Requires junit
b. The test cases - test/
c. The resources used in the test cases  - test/resources

4. Git Repository
-----------------
git@github.com:junction/jn_bulk_uploads.git

5. Fixes / Enhancements 
------------------------
a. Upon a successful upload; username, domain, and CSV are cached so that end users don't have to re-enter their params.
b. End users can launch and view the log file after executing the upload directly from confirmation modal
c. Executes upload process by hitting the Enter key
d. Modified username extraction by supporting e-mail addresses with Uppercase notations
e. Set focus on Password Textfield if Username has been filled

^^^^^^^^^^
- Added support for batch uploading or importing Phones, specifically Polycom phones.
- Wrote an Ant based build utiilty.

6. Packaging
-----------------------
Created an Ant based build file. Executing "Ant compile" will compile all the source, create the Jar files,
run the Jar Bundler utility, and initiate PackageMaker.
In order to Run "Ant compile" Both Ant and "JarBundler.jar" (http://informagen.com/JarBundler/) are required.

Created the app bundle using "Jar Bundler" followed by "PackageMaker"

7. TODOs
-----------------------
- Remove cleartext password from logging
- Refactor auto-generated swing based UI code
- Enhance PC Support
- Modify Progress bar to be show immediate processing. Currently, their is a bit of a lag, so the app appears a bit stagnant.
